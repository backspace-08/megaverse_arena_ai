"""Opponent information set.

This module is the single authority on what one side may know about the other
side's two hidden variables:

- ``shields``: shields the opponent currently holds, which will block our next
  attacks and then expire;
- ``bank``: stored bonus the opponent currently holds, which will inflate their
  next action budget.

The two are not independent. Both are paid for out of the same public
remainder, so ``shields + bank == remainder``. A world where the opponent holds
many shields is a world where they banked little, and vice versa. The joint
distribution is therefore the object of interest; separate marginals would
throw away the correlation that makes the game readable.

Nothing here reads resolver secrets. Every input is a public fact: a revealed
budget, a resolved attack count, a visible switch, or a blocked-attack count.
